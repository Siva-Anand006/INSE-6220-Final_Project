Conducted a study to enhance diabetes diagnosis by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on a dataset containing physiological attributes like glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI. Compared various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, to assess the impact of PCA on classification accuracy and performance. Results demonstrated improved accuracy in some models, particularly Naive Bayes, post-transformation. Evaluated performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess each model's effectiveness.
